# circle-quest

# --- Summary ---

#This project was initiated as part of the 2018 Shellhacks

This repo is for the development of the circle-quest game for the MATRIX-CREATOR. The game consists of a Hero who rolls 
#around a circular map comprised of the LED ring arond the Matrix Creator. The Hero must make his way to the goal (a green patch of 
#LED's) while avoiding the lava (red patch of LED's). The Hero's motion is controlled by tilting the device.
